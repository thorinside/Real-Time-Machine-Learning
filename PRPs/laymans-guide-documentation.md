# PRP: Comprehensive Layman's Guide to Real-Time Machine Learning Codebase

## 📋 Project Overview

This PRP provides complete context for creating a comprehensive, easy-to-understand guide to the Real-Time Machine Learning codebase that implements Learning Feature Trees (LF-Trees) using WOLF (Weighted Overlapping Linear Functions) approximation.

**Target Audience**: Computer Science bachelor graduates who understand basic programming and ML concepts but may not be familiar with advanced ML research or this specific approach.

## 🎯 Objective

Create comprehensive documentation that:
1. Explains the novel ML approach in accessible terms
2. Provides clear code walkthroughs
3. Includes practical usage examples
4. Explains the algorithms step-by-step
5. Highlights key innovations and advantages

## 📚 Context and Background

### What Makes This Special

This codebase implements a **revolutionary machine learning approach** that differs fundamentally from traditional neural networks:

1. **No Backpropagation**: Uses forward propagation credit assignment with "engrams" (memory traces)
2. **Self-Growing Architecture**: Trees automatically grow and partition data
3. **Real-Time Capable**: Designed for hardware acceleration (potential 200-20,000x speedup with GPU)
4. **Automatic Feature Design**: No manual feature engineering required
5. **96% Accuracy on MNIST**: Competitive performance with simpler, more interpretable approach

### Core Innovation: Learning Feature Trees (LF-Trees)

Think of LF-Trees as smart decision trees that:
- Create their own features automatically
- Use linear functions instead of simple thresholds
- Grow themselves based on data patterns
- Work together in "forests" for better accuracy

### Key Components Explained

#### 1. Sample Blocks (SB) - The Building Blocks
```cpp
struct SB {
    bool is_final;                    // Can this block still split?
    std::vector<double> C;            // Centroid (memory) of samples
    std::vector<double> W;            // Weights for linear function
    std::vector<size_t> active;       // Which pixels vary enough to matter
    std::vector<size_t> image_numbers; // Which images are in this block
    std::vector<SF> features;         // Features for splitting
    double FTvalue;                   // Split threshold
    size_t FTS, FTD;                  // Left/right children
};
```

**Layman's Explanation**: Sample Blocks are like smart containers that hold groups of similar images. They remember the "average" of their images (centroid) and can decide whether to split into smaller groups.

#### 2. The Learning Process

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with all 60,000 training images in one big block
2. **Find Patterns**: Calculate which pixels vary most between different digits
3. **Create Features**: Combine varying pixels into discriminative features
4. **Split Wisely**: Divide blocks to separate different digit classes
5. **Repeat**: Keep splitting until blocks are pure or too small

#### 3. Key Algorithms

##### `growTree()` - The Brain of Learning
- **Purpose**: Grows the tree by splitting blocks
- **How**: Computes centroids, removes constant pixels, creates splitting features
- **Location**: wolf.h:189

##### `createFeature()` - The Feature Engineer
- **Purpose**: Automatically creates discriminative features
- **How**: Finds pixel combinations that best separate targets from non-targets
- **Location**: wolf.h:302

##### `findBlock()` - The Navigator
- **Purpose**: Finds which block a new image belongs to
- **How**: Traverses the tree using feature comparisons
- **Location**: wolf.h:620

##### `evalBoundedSB()` - The Predictor
- **Purpose**: Calculates probability that an image is the target digit
- **How**: Uses linear function with learned weights
- **Location**: wolf.h:671

## 💡 Key Concepts for CS Graduates

### 1. WOLF Approximation vs Neural Networks

| Aspect | WOLF/LF-Trees | Neural Networks |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| Functions | Linear only | Non-linear activations |
| Learning | Forward propagation | Backpropagation |
| Architecture | Self-growing trees | Fixed layers |
| Interpretability | High (can trace decisions) | Low (black box) |
| Hardware | Highly parallelizable | Sequential dependencies |

### 2. Engrams and Forward Credit Assignment

**Traditional Neural Networks**:
```
Input → Hidden → Output → Error → Backpropagate → Update all weights
```

**LF-Trees with Engrams**:
```
Input → Find Block → Update local engram → Immediate local learning
```

**Advantage**: Each block learns independently, enabling massive parallelization.

### 3. Convolution on Features (Not Images!)

Traditional CNNs convolve raw pixels:
```
Raw Image → Convolution → Feature Maps
```

LF-Trees convolve computed features:
```
Raw Image → Compute Features → Convolve Features → Enhanced Features
```

This improves generalization without the computational cost of image convolution.

## 🚀 Usage Guide

### Basic Command
```bash
./RTML <project> <sensors> <trees> <min_split> <constancy> <conv_radius>
```

### Parameters Explained
- `project`: Dataset name (e.g., "MNIST")
- `sensors`: Input dimensions (784 for 28×28 MNIST images)
- `trees`: Number of trees (must be multiple of 10)
- `min_split`: Minimum samples before splitting (typically 10)
- `constancy`: Pixel variance threshold (typically 15.0)
- `conv_radius`: Feature convolution radius (typically 2.0)

### Example Runs
```bash
# Quick test (1 tree per digit = 10 trees)
./RTML MNIST 784 10 10 15.0 2.0

# Full accuracy (20 trees per digit = 200 trees)
./RTML MNIST 784 200 10 15.0 2.0
```

## 🔬 Algorithm Deep Dives

### Tree Growing Process

1. **Initialization** (wolf.h:189-224)
   - Load all images into root block
   - Compute initial centroid with tree-specific shift
   - Identify active (varying) pixels

2. **Variance Analysis** (wolf.h:273-279)
   ```cpp
   double Variance = Ex2 - Ex * Ex;
   if (Variance > constancyLimit * constancyLimit) {
       // Pixel varies enough to be useful
       stayActive.push_back(sensor);
   }
   ```

3. **Feature Creation** (wolf.h:380-424)
   - Find pixels that differ between targets and non-targets
   - Combine into linear features
   - Apply convolution for spatial relationships

4. **Smart Splitting** (wolf.h:509-530)
   - Choose split threshold to maximize class separation
   - Handle edge cases (all targets, all non-targets)

### Reinforcement Learning Integration

The system uses simple +1/-1 rewards (test_wolf.cpp:121):
```cpp
double reinforcement(uint8_t action, uint8_t label) {
    return (action == label) ? 1 : 0;  // Correct digit?
}
```

This enables various learning tasks:
- Digit classification (which digit is it?)
- Binary decisions (is it a 3 or 8?)
- Feature detection (does it have a horizontal bar?)

## 🎯 Performance Characteristics

### Training Performance
- **Sequential**: ~40 minutes for 200 trees on CPU
- **Parallel Potential**: ~12 seconds on GPU
- **Speedup**: 200-20,000x with CUDA implementation

### Inference Performance
- **Speed**: <1ms per image classification
- **Memory**: O(tree_size), not O(dataset_size)
- **Parallelizable**: Each tree evaluates independently

### Accuracy Results
- **MNIST Test Set**: 96% (competitive with CNNs)
- **Interpretability**: Can trace why each decision was made
- **Robustness**: Multiple trees vote for final decision
